                        Trees can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon(iv)oxide each year and can sequester 1 ton of carbon(iv)oxide by the time it reaches
                        40 years old.<br>
                        In addition, <i>trees absorb odors and pollutant gases</i> such as nitrogen oxides, ammonia, sulfur and ozone and filter
                        particulates out of the air by trapping them on their leaves and bark.

                        <i>Trees can cool a city by up to 10 degreed Fahrenheit</i>by shading homes and streets, breaking up urban "heat islands" and releasing
                        water vapour into the air through their leaves.

                        Trees were sacred to many ancient worlds and still hold special meaning in many cultures today. The Druids believed a number of trees
                        to be sacred, including <i> the Ash Tree</i> from which healing wands were made. Today, <i>many people in Madagascar worship</i> them
                        because they believe their ancestor's spirits live in the forests.

                        Did you know that<i> aspirin was derived from willow bark?</i> Or that dogwood bark has been used as a substitute for quinine? While many
                        drugs that come from plants and trees have been replaced by synthetics, there is no denying how important they are when it comes to
                        modern medicine and research.
